## Modifying Repository

If something is changed in the repository, a "pull" link will show up in abapGit. The changes must be pulled before new objects can be changed or added.

## Handling Licenses

Open-source projects on GitHub typically include a `LICENSE` file that describes repository's licensing terms.

If required by your license, make sure to reference or include it in one of your source code files.
