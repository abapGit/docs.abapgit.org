## General

The primary front-end for abapGit is **SAP GUI for Windows**. With limitations, abapGit can work with *SAP GUI for Java* and *SAP GUI for HTML*.

The abapGit application is displayed using a SAP GUI HTML Control embedded in SAP GUI.

### SAP GUI for Windows

abapGit is working without restrictions for *SAP GUI for Windows 7.60* or higher when using the HTML Control based on *Internet Explorer*.

:::info
With *SAP GUI for Windows 7.70* or higher, there is the option to use *Edge (based on Chromium)* as the HTML Control. 

Starting with *SAP GUI for Windows 8.00*, the *Edge (based on Chromium)* HTML Control is the default setting.
:::

:::warning
Using the *Edge (based on Chromium)* HTML Control with abapGit requires *SAP GUI for Windows 7.70 SP 14* or *SAP GUI for Windows 8.00 SP 3 patch 1 or SP 4* or higher (see SAP Note 3331099).
:::

Alternative 1:

Switch SAP GUI to use the *Internet Explorer* control in general.

Alternative 2:

Configure *Internet Explorer* as a fallback solution for abapGit. The solution is described in SAP Note 2957665:

1. Implement SAP Note 3153691
2. Add an entry to your Windows registry configuring the fallback for abapGit
   For your convenience, you can download preconfigured [BrowserControllFallback.reg](/assets/BrowserControlFallback.reg)
   and merge it to your registry. It points to [BrowserControlFallback.xml](/assets/BrowserControlFallback.xml).

### SAP GUI for Java

When you start abapGit for the first time using *SAP GUI for JAVA*, you will get a warning that this GUI is not supported and there might be issues.

You may confirm that you want to use this GUI anyway and continue.

Known issues:

- [Commit page is non-functional, #5082](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues/5082)

### SAP GUI for HTML

abapGit also works with *SAP GUI for HTML*. However, there are currently several known issues, which prevent proper usage of this GUI.

Known issues:

- [Issue running abapGit in WebGUI (SAP GUI for HTML), #4433](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues/4433)
- [SAP GUI for HTML: Toolbar on Repository List not working, #6567](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues/6567)
- [SAP GUI for HTML: Staging does not work correctly, #6568](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues/6568)

### Browser

A plain HTML version that runs in any browser is available as a [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/abapGit/web-edition).

This solution is currently limited by the fact that will use several SAP GUI popups that don't work in a browser.
