abapGit UI has several unobvious but convenient features.

## Command Palettes

Command palettes are a popular UI control available in modern editors like Sublime, VSCode, Atom and others. There are two command palettes available in abapGit.

### Command Selector

Pressing the `F1` key anywhere in abapGit will open a palette of all possible commands. Type one or more letters contained in the description of the command to narrow down the list. Then use the `arrow keys` and `Enter` to select and execute a command.

If you don't want to run any command, press `F1` again to close the palette.

### Repository Selector

Pressing the `F2` key anywhere in abapGit will open a palette of all existing repositories. Type one or more letters contained in the description of the repository to narrow down the list. Then use the `arrow keys` and `Enter` to select and jump to a repository.

If you don't want to select any repository, press `F2` again to close the palette.

## Keyboard Navigation

### General

abapGit supports the general browser control keys:

- `Escape`, `F3`, and `Alt + Left Arrow` go a page back
- `Alt + Right Arrow` goes a page forward

### Hotkeys

For each page, abapGit defines certain hotkeys (or keyboard shortcuts). If you press a hotkey, it will execute the corresponding command immediately. You can display the list of possible hotkeys by pressing `?` anywhere in abapGit. You can find a [Hotkeys Cheat Sheet](/user-guide/reference/hotkeys.md) under references.

To close the hotkey popup, press `?` again.

### Link Hints

abapGit provides a clever feature to highlight and select any link (including buttons and menu items) on a page. You can activate link hint in your [personal settings](/user-guide/setup/settings-personal.md#interaction).
