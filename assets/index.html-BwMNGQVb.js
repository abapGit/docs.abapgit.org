If a developer has a developer key to the system, the developer can perform these actions already. abapGit enables the developer to do mass export/changes/imports but not more than already possible to do manually.</p><p>Running automated security checks on the abapGit code will by design give a lot of errors, as abapGit will import, overwrite and change ABAP artifacts in the system in ways that might not be intended. Always review all code in remote repositories before importing to the target system, this is possible because abapGit is plain text unlike traditional transport files.</p>',9)),o("p",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("That being said, abapGit is used by multiple ")),n(i,{to:"/user-guide/other/where-used.html"},{default:p(()=>e[0]||(e[0]=[t("organizations")])),_:1}),e[2]||(e[2]=t(", all abapGit changes are reviewed via pull requests.
