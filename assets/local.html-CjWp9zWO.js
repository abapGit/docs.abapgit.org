Only global check variants are supported. Thus the check variant has to be available to all developers. A check variant can either make use of local checks of the developer system or a reference to a check variant on a remote ABAP Test Cockpit system. The available checks in a check variant on a remote ATC system may differ from the available checks of a check variant of the developer system due to the ATC system being on a newer release.

Findings of priority â‰¥ 3 are not reported. A check variant must be configured to activate this option. abapGit won&#39;t change its behavior based on the transport settings of the <code>Transport Tool Integration</code> of the ATC setup in transaction <code>ATC</code>.
