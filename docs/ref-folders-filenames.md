## Folders

abapGit is mapping SAP packages and subpackages to folders in the git repository. There are three options for defining the folder logic (mapping mode) which 
are described in the [Repository Settings](settings-dot-abapgit.html#folder-logic).

The correct setting (`Prefix`, `Mixed`, or `Full`) for your system typically depends on the name of the target package for the repository as well as 
your naming conventions. 

### Limitations

When creating a repository for your own package(s) or installing a third-party repository, the setting (when you create the repository in your system) does not have to match the setting
defined in the third-party repository. However, not all possible combinations are possible due to length restrictions of SAP package names. 

For example, if your target package name is already 20 characters long, installing a repository with mode `Prefix` and folder names longer than 
10 chararacters will lead to an error message since the resulting subpackage name will become too long. 

### Troubleshooting

`Unexpected package naming ({ package }). You might switch the folder logic`
`Folder logic: length = 0, parent: { parent_package }, child: { package }`

If these errors occur, then the package hierarchy cannot be converted to a folder structure for the given folder logic. First, try to use a different 
folder logic. If this does not work, change the naming conventions and possibly use a starting package with a shorter name.

`Package { package } exceeds ABAP 30-characters name limit`

Try to use a starting package with a shorter name. If this does not work, use a different folder logic. 

`Package { package } has a subpackage with the same name`

This error can happen if you try to install a repository with folder logic `Prefix` into a system where you selected folder logic `Full`.
Try using `Prefix` as in the original repository.

### Technical Details

The mapping is implemented in class `zcl_abapgit_folder_logic`, methods `package_to_path` (SAP to Repo) and `path_to_package` (Repo to SAP).

## Files

abapGit is mapping SAP objects and object parts to files in the git repository. For each object* at least one file is being created. 
Often there are two files, one containing the object metadata and one containing the coding. Some object are split into several files
to allow for easier editing and change tracking in git.

For example, DDIC objects are mapped to one file, programs are mapped to two files, and classes as well as function groups are mapped to several files.

Filenames has the following convertion:

`<object name>.<object type>.<extension>` or `<object name>.<object type>.<object part>.<extension>` 

The common extensions are `.xml` and `.json` for metadata as well as `.abap` for any coding. Other extensions are possible and used,
for example, for MIME objects.

You can find examples for most object types in the [abapGit Test Repositories](https://github.com/abapGit-tests).

The metadata is stored either in XML or JSON format. JSON format has been introduced for some object and is based the 
[ABAP File Format](https://github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats).

* Only for [supported object types](ref-supported.html). 

### Special Cases

There are some files with special meaning.

1. `.abapgit.xml`

This file contains [meta information](settings-dot-abapgit.html) of the abapGit project. The file must be located in the root folder of the git repository.

2. `.apack-manifest.xml`

This is an optional file which can be used to define [package dependencies](ref-apack.html) for your project.

3. `package.devc.xml`

abapGit repositories do not store any SAP package names. Only the package metadata is stored in these XML files. When installing a repository
abapGit will map the folder names to the SAP packages (see above).

4. `#namespace#`

`/NAMESPACE/` in SAP object names is mapped to `#namespace#` in filenames.

### Limitations

Git has a limit of 4096 characters for filenames. This is way more than required and allowed for many object names in SAP systems. Therefore,
creating files directly in git (manually or via automation) is limited by the possible object names in SAP systems. It's highly recommended
to always create objects in an SAP system and then push them to the repository.

Some characters used in SAP object names are not allowed in git filenames. Also some characters in object names cause problems when identifying 
the object later. Therefore, abapGit will escape such characters. Examples: `%, #, ., =, ?, <, >`.

There are cases where the name of an object is *not* unique across systems. This is usually the case if the object name is generated by the
SAP system when creating the object. Examples are object names based on GUIDs or number ranges. abapGit will map such object names to a unique, 
system independent identifier. Example: ICF Services (`SICF`).

### Troubleshooting

It's possible that SAP object names contain characters that are not valid for git filenames. In such case, please open an 
[issue](https://github.com/sbcgua/ajson/issues).

### Technical Details

The mapping is implemented in class `zcl_abapgit_filename_logic`, methods `object_to_file` (SAP to Repo) and `file_to_object` (Repo to SAP).
