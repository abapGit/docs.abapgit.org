## General

The primary front-end for abapGit is **SAP GUI for Windows**. With limitations, abapGit can work with *SAP GUI for Java* and *SAP GUI for HTML*. 

The abapGit application is displayed using a SAP GUI HTML Control embedded in SAP GUI.

### SAP GUI for Windows

abapGit is working without restrictions for *SAP GUI for Windows 7.60* or higher when using the HTML Control based on *Internet Explorer*.

With *SAP GUI for Windows 7.70* or higher, there is the option to use *Edge (based on Chromium)* as the HTML Control. Unfortunately, this control 
currently does **not** handle the `SAPEVENT` protocol which is used by abapGit (see below). Until this gap is closed by SAP, it's recommended
to use the *Internet Explorer* HTML Control.

Note: Starting with *SAP GUI for Windows 8.00*, the *Edge (based on Chromium)* HTML Control is the default setting.

Workaround 1:

Switch SAP GUI to use the *Internet Explorer* control in general.

Workaround 2:

Configure *Internet Explorer* as a fallback solution for abapGit. The solution is described in SAP Note 2957665:

1. Implement SAP Note 3153691 
2. Add an entry to your Windows registry configuring the fallback for abapGit 
   For your convinience, you can download preconfigured [BrowserControllFallback.reg](https://docs.abapgit.org/assets/BrowserControlFallback.reg) 
   and merge it to your registry. It points to [BrowserControlFallback.xml](https://docs.abapgit.org/assets/BrowserControlFallback.xml).

### SAP GUI for Java

When you start abapGit for the first using *SAP GUI for JAVA*, you will get a warning that this GUI is not supported and there might be issues. 

You may confirm that you want to use this GUI anyway and continue.

Known issues: 

- [Commit page is non-functional](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues/5082)

### SAP GUI for HTML

abapGit also works with *SAP GUI for HTML*. However, using the browser "Back" feature leads to an unusable state (see below). 
The workaround is to use "Back" buttons or menu items provided by abapGit.

Known issues: 

- [Issue running abapGit in WebGUI (SAP GUI for HTML)](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues/4433)

### Browser 

A plain HTML version that runs in any browser is available as a [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/abapGit/web-edition). 

This solution is currently limited by the fact that  will uses several SAP GUI popups that don't work in a browser.
